# Setting up LightBurn on your own laptop

This guide assumes you have not previously installed LightBurn on the target laptop.
If you have then you more than likely do not need this guide, can download the device profile file from step 2 and go on your merry way.

1. Install LightBurn from [here](https://lightburnsoftware.com/).
2. Download [`device_profile.lbdev`](../configs/device_profile.lbdev).
3. Launch LightBurn.
4. Either activate the trial or purchase your own license and activate that (see note below).
5. When prompted to add a machine, import the file downloaded in step 2.
6. You should now have a machine named Hoshiguma available, use this when you want to prepare or machine jobs on this laser.

## LightBurn discount

We (Maker Space) have a code for discounted Light Burn licenses for members.
If you would like one, ask the person who did your laser training.

Note that the license is only to be using with the laser cutter in Maker Space.
Should you need to use other machines you should pay for a full license.
